# Advanced Solar Irradiance Prediction Using Hybrid XGBoost and Random Forest Models
A machine learning-based web application that predicts solar irradiance using a combination of **XGBoost** and **Random Forest** models. This project leverages historical and environmental data (e.g., temperature, DHI, GHI, solar angles) to deliver accurate solar irradiance forecasts.
ðŸ“Œ Key Features
- **Hybrid Model:** Combines XGBoost and Random Forest for enhanced prediction accuracy.
- **Interactive Web Interface:** Users can input relevant parameters via a user-friendly Flask-powered front end.
- **Comprehensive Dataset:** Trained on real-world data from multiple Indian states.
- **Responsive Design:** Built with HTML and CSS for smooth user interaction.
ðŸš€ Usage
1. Input values such as latitude, temperature, and solar zenith angle.
2. Get predicted solar irradiance instantly (in W/mÂ²).
